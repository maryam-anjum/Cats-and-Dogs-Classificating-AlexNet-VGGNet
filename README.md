Cats vs Dogs Classification using AlexNet and VGGNet
This repository contains the implementation of deep learning models for classifying images of cats and dogs using AlexNet and VGGNet architectures. The project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks, leveraging the power of these architectures to achieve accurate classification results.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build robust image classifiers that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs using AlexNet and VGGNet. The models are trained on a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs, and the trained models are then evaluated on a separate test set to assess their performance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to normalize the images and ensure consistency in size and format.
Model Architectures: Implementation of the AlexNet and VGGNet architectures with modifications to suit the specific task of binary classification.
Training and Validation: The models are trained using data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. The training process includes monitoring the loss and accuracy on a validation set to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on a test set to determine their accuracy and other performance metrics.
Visualization: Tools and scripts for visualizing the training process, including loss and accuracy curves, and sample predictions.

Analysis
Training Performance: VGGNet demonstrated significantly better training performance compared to AlexNet with a higher accuracy (84.27% vs. 77.10%) and a lower loss (0.3465 vs. 0.4842). This suggests that VGGNet is better at fitting the training data due to its deeper architecture which allows it to capture more complex patterns.
Testing Performance: On the test data, VGGNet outperformed AlexNet, achieving a higher accuracy (83.12% vs. 70.29%) and a lower loss (0.3689 vs. 0.6105). This indicates that VGGNet not only learned better from the training data but also generalized better to unseen data.
Overfitting: Both models showed a drop in performance from training to testing, which is expected. However, the drop was less pronounced for VGGNet, suggesting it managed to maintain good generalization. AlexNet's larger performance drop indicates it might have overfitted the training data to a greater extent.
Conclusion
VGGNet clearly outperforms AlexNet in both training and testing scenarios. The deeper architecture of VGGNet, with its ability to extract more detailed features, leads to better performance and generalization. For tasks requiring higher accuracy and robustness, VGGNet is the preferable choice over AlexNet. However, AlexNet's simpler architecture and faster training time might still make it suitable for applications where computational resources are limited.
